			<h2>IDEO's Wunderfaire</h2>

			<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/3110061059010183/">IDEO's Wunderfaire</a> is an annual design event catered towards all age groups. This fantastic event hosts designers from all over the nation, including your very own IDEO employees, who showcases all their talented artwork and designs. This was my first time ever going to a design event that showcases all the different types of artwork. You can pick and choose which art piece to buy, and you can give it as a gift or use it for yourself. </p>

			<p>I had the honor to be invited to this event, as not everyone can just go. During the event, I was able to meet and network with all different types of designers, from pottery makers, to jewelry designers, and even to tea makers! It was an amazing event to attend. I spoke to a lot of IDEO employees and asked about their passion. One said their passion was creating poems for indviduals. All you needed to do was tell them how you were feeling at any moment and this person would be able to write an entire poem based on that! I thought it was really cool.</p>

			<p>I learned a lot of great ideas for desinging my own artwork in the future. I was particularly interested in artists who designed their own artwork and sold it to individuals at the fair. They were not your normal piece of artwork, these indivdiuals utilized stenciles and special pens to create the perfect penmanship design. I inquired one of the artists there, and he told me it took him a whopping 6 months to complete just one piece of art! That is dedication right there. All in all I had a lot of fun, and I would definitely go again next year. I was able to bring back a little bit of my own souvenier, and I was very thankful.</p>
