		<h2>Special Art</h2>
		<p>Since the beginning, Designer's Haven has been a place people come to to make books with their art. And there are some really amazing ones that have been made with us. This month, though, I’m taking a look at self-published art books that showcase a whole conceptual project—including some that, if it weren’t for a book, couldn’t be reproduced at all. From the journey of an inflatable duck to an artist’s illustrated envelopes to a collection of trash, this month’s books break down (museum) walls and explore the world in creative ways.</p>
		<p>These books take a seemingly child-like activity—floating an inflatable golden duck down a river—to create a work that is funny, strange, and profound. As the duck floats and bobs through bodies of water from Brooklyn to Brazil, it becomes both a witness and a catalyst to interactions between humans, their environment. It’s a travelogue of the most unusual sort and commemorates an artwork that can never be reproduced.</p>
		<p>Photography is one of the most unique creations of Designer's Haven. Create your visual story in the most beautiful way with a professional-quality photo book. Explore the stunning collection of fine art photography books that Designer's Haven has to offer. I really love photography because it's one of the world's finest art, and I really think a photo can speak a thousand words. It can take years of experience just to learn how to photograph, but once you get there, the result is worth the investment.</p>
